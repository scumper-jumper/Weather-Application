A Java-based Weather App fetches real-time weather data using a public API (such as OpenWeatherMap). The app allows users to input a city name and displays key information like temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed. It utilizes Java for backend logic, HTTP requests to interact with the API, and libraries like JSON or Gson to parse the response. The app can be implemented with a GUI (using Swing or JavaFX) or as a simple console application, (i used Java Swing).
